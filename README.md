## What's Cedar?

**Cedar-PHP (or just "Cedar") is a clone of Nintendo's Miiverse written in, well, PHP!** It sports many functions of Miiverse such as:

- Posting
- Yeahing
- Mii Empathies
- Favorite Posts
- Popular Posts
- Communities
- and much more!

Cedar also contains many new features Miiverse didn't originally have such as:

- posting images and gifs
- Viewing replies
- Using custom profile images
- Using any color theme you want
- and posts that allow up to 1000 characters!

## Open Source + Hosting

**What's the best part about Cedar?** It's open source, so anybody with knowledge of web hosting can respin and host their own versions of Cedar! Cedar is coded in PHP, a lightning fast server-side interpreted programming language. It's also recommended that you use [x10hosting](https://x10hosting.com/) to host Cedar. But you can use whatever you want as long as you know how to set it up.

## Can I help with Cedar?

**Absolutely! Pull requests are accepted as long as they make Cedar a better social network.** You can also mention any issues or features you'd like to see in the future. Cedar is still early in development, so any contributions you make would help greatly!
